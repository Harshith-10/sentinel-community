# Remote Code Execution Service - Sentinel

A scalable, cloud-native remote code execution service designed for high-performance and automatic scaling with Kubernetes.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Cloud-Native Design with Kubernetes
- **Master Service**: A highly available API server that orchestrates job distribution.
- **Language-Specific Executor Pods**: Isolated and independently scalable execution environments for each language.
- **Redis**: Acts as the message broker for the job queue.
- **KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling)**: Provides automatic scaling of executor pods based on the number of jobs in the queue.

### Benefits
- **Massive Scalability**: Horizontally scales to handle thousands of concurrent users.
- **Intelligent Autoscaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of language-specific pods based on real-time demand, scaling down to zero to save costs.
- **High Availability**: Replicated master and executor services ensure resilience and no single point of failure.
- **Resource Optimization**: Fine-grained resource allocation and autoscaling for each language.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system is self-healing, with Kubernetes automatically replacing failed pods.

## Features

- **Multi-language support**: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Go
- **Test case execution**: Run code against multiple test cases with automatic result comparison
- **Intelligent load balancing**: Distributes jobs to the least loaded containers.
- **Asynchronous execution**: Redis-based job queue with Bull.
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution in isolated containers with a non-root user.
- **IP-based Rate limiting**: Protects the service from abuse.
- **Health monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks for all services.
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with strict type checking.

## üöÄ Kubernetes Deployment

**Prerequisites:**
* A running Kubernetes cluster.
* `kubectl` configured to connect to your cluster.
* [KEDA](https://keda.sh/docs/2.10/deploy/) installed in your cluster.
* Docker images for the services pushed to a container registry.

1.  **Build and Push Docker Images**:
    Replace `your-docker-repo` in `package.json` with your Docker Hub username or private registry.
    ```bash
    npm run docker:build
    npm run docker:push
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
    Navigate to the `k8s` directory and apply the manifests.
    ```bash
    cd k8s
    kubectl apply -f .
    ```

3.  **Access the Service**:
    Find the external IP of the `sentinel-master-service`.
    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    ```
    You can then access the API at `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

**Current Implementation:**
- **Container Security**: Executors run as a non-root user.
- **Resource Limits**: Kubernetes deployments have CPU and memory limits.
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based rate limiting is in place.
- **Network Policies**: (Recommended) Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict communication between pods.

**Production Recommendations:**
- **gVisor or Kata Containers**: Use sandboxed container runtimes for stronger isolation.
- **Seccomp and AppArmor**: Apply security profiles to restrict the system calls that can be made from within a container.
- **Managed Redis**: Use a managed Redis service for better security and reliability.
- **Ingress Controller**: Use an Ingress controller with a WAF (Web Application Firewall) for advanced traffic filtering and security.
- **Secrets Management**: Store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials in Kubernetes Secrets.
